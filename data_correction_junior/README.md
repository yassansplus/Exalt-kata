## The Problem

Each endpoint holds some data, but someone made a mistake and shuffled it.
Thankfully, all users ids are still here ! 
You have to fix it ! For that, you have to make a backup of each endpoint locally (one json file per endpoint),
then compile them in one file, sanitize the data, store it locally and upload it on [Krates](https://app.krat.es/).

Here are the endpoints : 
GET : https://recrutement-practice-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/informations.json
```json
{
  "$userId" : {
    "name":"L43t1t14"
  }
}
```
GET : https://recrutement-practice-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/jobs.json
```json
{
  "$userId" : {
    "job": "Developer"
  }
}
```
GET : https://recrutement-practice-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/users.json
````json
{
  "$userId":{
    "city": "pArIs",
    "age": 26
  }
}
````
Be careful when you sanitize the data because : 
- if user name is "#ERROR", you have to skip it and pick the name in another table
- name vowel are replaced by number (e by 3, a by 4, i by 1 and o by 0).
- cities are not written in a proper way (there are some letters in uppercase in the middle of the word, but they should only be at the beginning)
- You have to delete all `null` or `undefined` fields in the sanitize format
Some informations like name are injected in the bad table, so you've to sort them :
- always take the name in users, and if missing, pick it in an other table if available
- always take the age in informations, and if missing, pick it in an other table

FIY, the output should look like results.json.


### Bonus : 
Create a unit test, that compare your result to the results.json file.
